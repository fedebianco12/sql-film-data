### Query 1
##### Which are the 10 highest-spending districts, and how much have they spent?

The top 10 highest-spending districts are listed below, with Buenos Aires being
the highest, and Tamil Nadu being the lowest.

Although there is a visible correlation between spend and number of films
rented, we can see that in some cases, more rentals resulted in fewer USD spent,
suggesting that film rental prices may be lower in those districts.

In terms of USD spent, the largest differences appear to be between Buenos
Aires and California, and Uttar-Pradesh an Maharashtra. A lead difference
query could readily answer this question.

### Query 2
##### What amount was spent and how many rentals were there for the top 5-grossing categories?

Based on the chart, we can see the amount of rentals and USD spent per category,
for the 5 categories with the highest spends. A point to note is relatively low
amount of films rented vs. USD generated for sci-fi, suggesting that each video
rental generates significantly more than for other categories. The inverse seems
to be true for animation.


### Query 3
##### Average amount spent and rentals by spending decile?
Based on the chart’s visualization, we can see that the average rentals
correlate strongly with the amount spent among all deciles. In particular,
there is a jump between the ninth and tenth deciles both in terms of average
spent and average rentals. This is a continuation of the overall pattern
observed throughout.


### Query 4
##### For the top 25% longest family films, how many films are there per category?
The graphic shows the top 25% of longest films, divided into their counts per
category. The animation category is the largest category, with 22 videos—this
can bring up certain questions, such as how the categories are classified: is it
possible that “children” and “comedy” movies are also included in the animation
category?
